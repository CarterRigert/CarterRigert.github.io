                        I'm a computer science student at the University of Utah passionate about software development. I'm graduating in May 2023 and looking forward to an exciting career in the tech industry. I have experience with a range of programming languages, including C#, Java, C++, and Python. I'm highly motivated and always eager to learn new technologies and best practices.
